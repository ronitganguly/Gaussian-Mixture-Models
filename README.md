# Gaussian-Mixture-Models
# Introduction

Clustering is a way of identifying the unlabeled data in groups. It is based on the understanding that points in a cluster are similar to each other and they are different from the other points in the other clusters [1]. For example, in our dataset of digits (total 1797 in number), each and every digit is 32X32 pixels hand-written picture of 0 to 9 digits. When transformed to 2 dimensional PCA coordinates, we get many scattered data-points which can be grouped and analysed. 

This case study revolves around finding clusters in our digits dataset taken from SKlearn's repository [2]. 

# Objective: 

1.	To use Gaussian Mixture model as clustering algorithm and find out which digit is getting grouped or split between clusters.

2.	To explore several model selection methods: 
•	AIC (Akaike information criterion)
•	BIC (Bayesian information criterion)
•	Silhouette Score
•	Cross-validation
	And analyse what each model is saying about the optimum number of clusters in our data.
